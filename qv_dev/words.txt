introduction
the

and
educational
contributions
of
hbcus
the
higher

act
of

defines
an
hbcu
as
any
historically
black
college
or
university
that
was
established
prior
to
whose
principal
mission
was
and
is
the
education
of
black

according
to
the

s
board
of

on

many
hbcus
were
formed
to
eliminate
the
adverse
residual
effects
of
slavery
plus
a
century
of
legally
sanctioned
discrimination
against
american
citizens
of
african
descent
only
a
few
colleges
dedicated
to
educating
african
american
students
were
in
existence
before
the
civil
war
after
the
war
through
the
efforts
of
missionary
societies
the
freedmen
s
bureau
and
african
american
churches
these
institutions
began
to
proliferate
it
would
take
decades
and
new
federal
law
most
notably
the
morrill
land
grant
act
of
before
states
were
required
to
provide
african
americans
as
well
as
whites
with
access
to
higher
education
instead
of
integrating
white
only
institutions
many
southern
states
responded
by
creating
separate
colleges
and
universities
for
african
american
students
today
there
are
accredited
hbcus
public
and
private
concentrated
in
states
the
district
of
columbia
and
the
u
s
virgin
islands
they
enroll
almost
students
approximately
percent
of
whom
are
african
american
and
percent
are
from
low
income
families
the
value
of
hbcus
is
not
confined
to
economic
impacts
consider
too
their
disproportionate
success
at
helping
african
american
college
students
earn
bachelor

degrees
and
more
in
for
example
while

accounted

in

hbcus
also
provide
a
solid
foundation
for
even
higher
academic
achievement
according
to
the

the
top
eight

where

earned
their

hbcus
achieve
these
positive
outcomes
with
fewer
resources
the
cost
of
attending
an
hbcu
in
was
percent
less
on
average
than
for
a
non
hbcu
even
more
remarkable
is
that
these
outcomes
are
achieved
while
working
with
a
high
proportion
of
low

students
who
often
require
more
support
to

a

sponsored

shows
hbcus
provide
black

with
a
better
college
experience
than
they
would
get
at
non

the

study
concludes
that
black

are
more

to
be
thriving
in

and
financial
well
being
than
black

who
did
not
receive

from

in

black

this

the
shortterm
economic

the

that

were
estimated
for
the
three
most
important
categories
of

detailed
in
the
introduction
to

of
this

the
fundamental
finding
is
that
each

creates
substantial
recurring
annual
economic

for
its
regional

these

are
significant
and
are

year

for
example
in
terms
of
output

the
nation
s
hbcus
would
rank
on
the

this
is
roughly
equal
to
the

and
slightly
larger
than
the
revenues
of
familiar
corporations
such
as
marriott

the

demonstrate
quantitatively
rather
than
intuitively
that

are
enduring
pillars

methodology
estimating

estimating
the
economic

of
the
nation
s
hbcus
on
their
regional

involved
five
basic
steps
first
the
nation
s
hbcus
were
identified
second
spending
by
each
hbcu
was
estimated
third
spending
by
students
was
estimated
fourth
economic
models
were
built
for
each
hbcu
s
regional
economy
finally
the
regional
economic
models
were
used
to
estimate
the
total
economic
impacts
of
spending
by
each
hbcu
and
its
students
the
total
annual
economic
impact
of
hbcu
related
spending
consists
of
the
net
changes
in
regional
output
value
added
labor
income
and
employment
that
are
due
to
initial
spending
by
the
institution
and
its
students
the
total
economic
impact
includes
the
impact
of
the
initial
round
of
spending
and
the
secondary
or
indirect
and
induced
spending
the
multiplier
effect
that
occurs
when
the
initial
expenditures
are
respent
figure
provides
a
schematic
representation
of

relationships
indirect
spending
refers
to
the
changes
in
inter
industry
purchases
as
a
region
s
industries
respond
to
the
additional
demands
triggered
by
spending
by
the
hbcu
its
faculty
and
staff
and
its
students
it
consists
of
the
ripples
of
activity
that
are
created
when
an
institution
its
employees
and
its
students
purchase
goods
or
services
from
other
industries
located
in
the
host
community
induced
spending
is
similar
to
indirect
spending
except
that
it
refers
to
the
additional
demand
triggered
by
spending
by
the
region
s
households
as
their
income
increases
due
to
changes
in
production
basically
the
induced
impact
captures
the
ripples
of
activity
that
are
created
when
households
spend
more
due
to
increases
in
their
earnings
caused
by
direct
and
indirect
spending
the
sum
of
the
direct
indirect

economic

is
the

plus
the

generated
by

of

of

the
magnitude
of

depends
on
what

leaves
the

during

therefore

that
the

multiplier
is
the

in

is
which
creates
a

the

flows
out

the

now
the
total
economic

the

is
after
seven

obviously
multiplier

in

are

to
be
larger
than
those
in

that

multiplier

also

in

the

with
the

the
larger
the

for
that

for
example
the
personal

business
services
and
entertainment
industries
have
intricate
relationships
with
local
supporting
industries
and
therefore
have
relatively
high
multiplier
values
conversely
electric
gas
and
sanitary

usually
are
less
intertwined
with

and
their

are

if

economic

this

some

the

when

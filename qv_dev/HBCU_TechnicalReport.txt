EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) make substantial contributions to the economic
development of the nation and to the economic success of their graduates. This study quantifies how much
HBCUs are interwoven into the business fabric of the regional economy of each institution and how much
graduates benefit in terms of increased earnings over a working lifetime.
The Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, defines an HBCU as “… any historically black* college or
university that was established prior to 1964, whose principal mission was, and is, the education of black
Americans.” According to the President’s Board of Advisors on Historically Black Colleges and Universities
(2005), many HBCUs were formed to eliminate the adverse residual effects of slavery, plus a century of
legally sanctioned discrimination against American citizens of African descent. In 2014, there were 101
accredited HBCUs operating in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. (Only 100
HBCUs are covered by this report due to data limitations.) Most are located in the Southeast and are near
areas with low levels of prosperity and well-being, where the generation of economic activity is particularly
important.
Major Findings
HBCUs are pillars of their host communities, generating economic impacts year after year. In 2014,
nationwide, the economic impact of HBCUs on their regional economies included:
• Total initial spending by the nation’s 100 HBCUs was $10.3 billion. Initial spending is the combination
of three types of spending – spending by the institution for personnel services (wages, salaries, and
benefits), spending by the institution for operating expenses, and spending by students.
• The total economic impact on output (sales) is $14.8 billion. Total output impacts are the most inclusive,
largest measures of economic impact; are the most frequently cited measure of economic impact; and
are typically emphasized in press releases and other communications. Conceptualized as the equivalent
of business revenue, sales, or gross receipts, total output is the value of production by all industries,
including intermediate inputs.
• Public HBCUs account for $9.6 billion of the output impact, or 65 percent of the total amount. Private,
non-profit, HBCUs account for $5.2 billion of the output impact, or 35 percent of the total amount.
• Dividing the total output impact ($14.8 billion) by initial spending ($10.3 billion) yields a multiplier of 1.44.
In other words, every dollar in initial spending generates an additional 44 cents for the regional economy.
The multiplier captures the regional economic repercussions of the flows of respending that take place
throughout the region until initial spending has completely leaked to other regions. In short, it measures
the response of the regional economy to a change in spending.
• The economic impact of an HBCU is most easily understood in terms of its effects on employment.
Collectively, the employment impact of the nation’s HBCUs on their regional economies was 134,090
jobs. Approximately 43 percent (57,868) were on-campus jobs at the HBCUs, and 57 percent (76,222)
*”African American” and “black” are used interchangeably throughout this report.

were off-campus jobs. For each job created on campus, there were 1.3 off-campus jobs that existed
because of spending related to the HBCU. To provide perspective, the rolled-up employment impact of
the nation’s HBCUs exceeded the number of jobs at Oracle (132,000), Convergys (130,000), and Honeywell
International (129,000), the nation’s 48th, 49th, and 50th largest private employers, respectively.
• In terms of value-added (gross regional product), HBCUs generated $10.1 billion. Gross regional product,
like output, is a measure of the value of production of all industries, but does not include the value of
intermediate inputs. Gross regional product equals output less intermediate purchases.
• The economic impact of the nation’s HBCUs expressed in terms of labor income was $7.3 billion. Labor
income includes all forms of employment income, such as wages, salaries, benefits, and proprietors’
income.
• The $3.9 billion that HBCUs spent on wages, salaries, and benefits generated $7.9 billion in output, $6.3
billion in regional product, $5.2 billion in labor income, and 88,315 jobs. The $2.7 billion that HBCUs
spent on operations generated $2.6 billion in output, $1.4 billion in regional product, $813 million in labor
income, and 18,209 jobs. The $3.7 billion in spending by HBCU students generated $4.3 billion in output,
$2.4 billion in regional product, $1.3 billion in labor income, and 27,566 jobs.
• The economic success of the graduates of HBCUs can be measured in terms of higher earnings over a
working lifetime. The 50,037 HBCU graduates in the Class of 2014 can expect work-life earnings of $130
billion; that is 56 percent ($46 billion) more than they could expect to earn without their 2014 certificates
or degrees. That amounts to an additional $926,666 in work-life earnings per graduate. On average, a
certificate is worth $204,464 more than a high school diploma, an associate’s degree is worth $463,112
more than a high school diploma, and a bachelor’s degree is worth $1,101,200 more than a high school
diploma. A master’s degree is worth $431,679 more than a bachelor’s degree, a doctoral degree is worth
$724,005 more than a master’s degree, and a professional degree is worth $1,819,966 more than a
bachelor’s degree.
These recurring annual benefits permeate the private and public sectors of the communities that host
HBCUs. These economic impacts demonstrate that continued emphasis on HBCUs as pillars of the
economy translates into jobs, higher incomes, and greater production of goods and services. The analysis
also shows that the economic worth of an HBCU education over the course of a graduate’s working lifetime
is considerable.
Methodology
The short-term economic impact of an HBCU is defined as the change in overall economic activity that
is associated with HBCU-related spending. For each HBCU, economic impacts were estimated, in 2014
dollars, for the three most important categories of college- and university-related expenditures: (1)
spending by the institutions for wages, salaries and fringe benefits, (2) spending by the institutions for
operating expenses, and (3) spending by students who attend the institutions. Most of the data used to
estimate HBCU-related spending was obtained from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES)
Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS). Other data sources were the College Board’s

HBCUs MAKE AMERICA STRONG: THE POSITIVE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES TECHNICAL REPORT
Annual Survey of Colleges, various annual Consumer Expenditure Surveys conducted by the U.S. Bureau
of Labor Statistics (BLS), and a special BLS study of expenditures of college-age students. The economic
impact estimates are based on regional input-output models of each HBCU’s regional economy. The
Impact Analysis for Planning (IMPLAN)-Online input-output modeling system was applied to the HBCUrelated
spending estimates to calculate four indicators of impact: output (sales), value-added (gross
regional product), labor income (wages, salaries, benefits, and proprietors’ income), and employment.
The synthetic work-life estimates for each HBCU are derived from synthetic estimates of work-life
earnings by educational attainment obtained from the Census Bureau’s analysis of data from the
American Community Survey. These earnings are “expected average amounts” based on cross-sectional
earnings data for all persons aged 25-64 who maintain full-time, year-round employment for the entire
time. U.S.-level data was used rather than data specific to each HBCU’s regional economy, and the
synthetic estimates are based on median earnings data. The resulting totals represent what individuals
with the same education level could expect to earn, on average, in 2014 dollars, during a hypothetical
40-year working life of full-time, year-round employment. The estimates therefore are illustrative and
do not predict actual future earnings, especially for those who do not anticipate full-time, year-round
employment.
INTRODUCTION: THE HISTORY AND EDUCATIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS OF HBCUs
The Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, defines an HBCU as “… any historically black college or
university that was established prior to 1964, whose principal mission was, and is, the education of black
Americans.” According to the President’s Board of Advisors on Historically Black Colleges and Universities
(2005), many HBCUs were formed to eliminate the adverse residual effects of slavery, plus a century of
legally sanctioned discrimination against American citizens of African descent.
Only a few colleges dedicated to educating African American students were in existence before the Civil
War. After the war, through the efforts of missionary societies, the Freedmen’s Bureau and African
American churches, these institutions began to proliferate.
It would take decades, and new federal law—most notably, the Morrill Land-Grant Act of 1890—before
states were required to provide African Americans, as well as whites, with access to higher education.
Instead of integrating white-only institutions, many southern states responded by creating separate
colleges and universities for African American students.
Today, there are 101 accredited HBCUs, public and private, concentrated in 19 states, the District of
Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands. They enroll almost 300,000 students, approximately 80 percent of
whom are African American, and 70 percent are from low-income families.
The value of HBCUs is not confined to economic impacts; consider, too, their disproportionate success
at helping African American college students earn bachelor’s degrees and more. In 2014, for example,
while HBCUs accounted for only 3 percent of public and not-for-profit private institutions receiving federal

HBCU
student aid, they enrolled 10 percent of African American college students nationwide. And those 10
percent, in turn, accounted for 17 percent of the bachelor’s degrees earned by African Americans—and 24
percent of the degrees earned by African Americans in “STEM” fields: science, technology, engineering
and math. HBCUs also provide a solid foundation for even higher academic achievement. According to
the National Science Foundation, the top eight institutions where African American Ph.D.s in science and
engineering earned their bachelor’s degrees from 2002 to 2011 were all HBCUs.
HBCUs achieve these positive outcomes with fewer resources. The cost of attending an HBCU in 2014
was 27 percent less, on average, than for a non-HBCU. Even more remarkable is that these outcomes are
achieved while working with a high proportion of low-income students who often require more support to
navigate the college experience.
A 2015 Gallup poll sponsored by USA Funds shows HBCUs provide black graduates with a better college
experience than they would get at non-HBCUs. The Gallup-USA Funds study concludes that, “Black HBCU
graduates are more likely to be thriving in purpose and financial well-being than black graduates who
did not receive their degrees from HBCUs.” In essence, black HBCU graduates were more prepared for
life and more likely to be engaged at work than black graduates of non-HBCUs. HBCU graduates flourish
relative to black graduates of non-HBCUs.
PART 1: THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF HBCUs ON THEIR REGIONAL ECONOMIES
How much does a region benefit economically from hosting an HBCU? Traditionally, the benefits are
discussed in broad, qualitative terms that often fail to satisfy those who demand tangible evidence of the
economic links between the academic community and the community as a whole. By contrast, this report
quantifies the economic benefits that the nation’s HBCUs convey to their regional locations.
The benefits are estimated for the three most important categories of HBCU-related expenditures: (1)
spending by the institutions for salaries, wages, and fringe benefits, (2) other institutional spending, such
as operating expenses; and (3) spending by the students. The economic impact estimates are based on
input-output models of each institution’s regional economy, certain necessary assumptions, and available
data on annual spending in the specified categories. Moreover, the emphasis is on funds received by
residents in the region that hosts each HBCU. The study reports expenditures and impacts for 2014 in
inflation-adjusted dollars.
Results
The economic benefits that the nation’s HBCUs conveyed to their host communities in 2014 are substantial.
The IMPLAN model calculated four indicators of impact—total output, total value-added, total labor
income, and total employment—for each category of initial spending. In addition to providing estimates for
the total impact of all HBCUs, the results are presented by institution control (public versus private), as
well as for individual HBCUs.

Total Initial Spending
For each institution, total initial spending accruing
to the institution’s regional economy is the
combination of three types of spending: spending
by the institution for personnel services (wages,
salaries, and benefits), spending by the institution
for operating expenses, and spending by that
institution’s students. Estimates of initial spending
for 2014 are reported in Tables 1, 2, 3, and 4.
For 2014, the initial spending associated with the
nation’s 100 HBCUs was $10.3 billion. Spending
originating from personnel services accounted for
38 percent ($3.9 billion) of initial spending, spending
due to operating expenses accounted for 26 percent
($2.7 billion), and students’ personal expenditures
accounted for 36 percent ($3.7 billion). Of all the
HBCUs (public and private), Howard University’s
$959 million in initial spending was by far the
largest in the nation.
Public HBCUs accounted for $6.8 billion in initial
spending, or 66 percent of the total amount. In
order, the top 10 public HBCUs ranked by the
amount of their initial spending were:
1. Florida A&M University ($408 million)
2. Texas Southern University ($354 million)
3. North Carolina A&T State University ($327
million)
4. Morgan State University ($282 million)
5. Jackson State University ($275 million)
6. Prairie View A&M University ($266 million)
7. Tennessee State University ($264 million)
8. North Carolina Central University ($248 million)
9. Alabama State University ($215 million)
10. The University of the District of Columbia ($202
million)
Private, non-profit HBCUs accounted for $3.5
billion in initial spending, or 34 percent of the total
amount. Ranked by the amount of their initial
spending, the top 10 private, nonprofit HBCUs were:
1. Howard University ($959 million)
2. Hampton University ($201 million)
3. Tuskegee University ($188 million)
4. Meharry Medical College ($147 million)
5. Morehouse School of Medicine ($146 million)
6. Xavier University of Louisiana ($127 million)
7. Clark Atlanta University ($119 million)
8. Spelman College ($117 million)
9. Morehouse College ($115 million)
10. Bethune-Cookman University ($111 million)
Total Output Impact
The output impact was calculated for each category
of initial spending, based on the impacts of the
first round of spending and the respending of
these amounts—the multiplier effect. Total output
impacts are the most inclusive, largest measures
of economic impact. Output impacts are also the
most frequently cited measure of economic impact
and are typically emphasized in press releases and
other communications. Essentially the equivalent
of business revenue, sales, or gross receipts, total
output is the value of production by all industries,
including households. Output impacts are reported
in Tables 1, 2, 3, and 4.

HBCU
Measured in the simplest and broadest possible
terms, the total economic impact of the nation’s 100
HBCUs on their host economies was $14.8 billion.
This amount represents the combined impact of all
100 institutions on their host communities. Of the
2014 output impact, $10.3 billion (69 percent) was
initial spending by the institutions and students,
while $4.5 billion (31 percent) was the induced
and respending impact or multiplier effect (the
difference between output impact and initial
spending). The multiplier captures the regional
economic repercussions of the flows of respending
that take place throughout the region until the initial
spending has completely leaked to other regions.
The average multiplier value for all institutions was
1.44, obtained by dividing the total output impact
($14.8 billion) by initial spending ($10.3 billion). On
average, therefore, every dollar of initial spending
generated an additional 44 cents for the economy
of the region that hosts the institution. Thus, for all
institutions combined, the output impact was 1.44
times greater than their initial spending.
Output multipliers for the individual HBCUs
are reported in the last column of Table 4. The
magnitude of the multiplier varies among the
individual HBCUs and categories of spending.
Multiplier effects in large, self-sufficient regions
are likely to be larger than those in small, rural or
specialized regions that are less able to capture
spending for necessary goods and services.
Multipliers are higher for HBCU spending on wages
and salaries than for other institutional spending.
Public HBCUs accounted for $9.6 billion of the
output impact, or 65 percent of the total amount. In
order, the public HBCUs with the 10 largest output
impacts in 2014 were:
1. Florida A&M University ($557 million)
2. Texas Southern University ($530 million)
3. North Carolina A&T State University
($488 million)
4. Tennessee State University ($458 million)
5. Morgan State University ($439 million)
6. Jackson State University ($418 million)
7. Prairie View A&M University ($403 million)
8. North Carolina Central University ($343 million)
9. The University of the District of Columbia
($314 million)
10. Alabama State University ($290 million)
Private HBCUs accounted for $5.2 billion of the
output impact, or 35 percent of the total amount. Of
these HBCUs, the institutions with the 10 largest
output impacts in 2014 were:
1. Howard University ($1.5 billion)
2. Meharry Medical College ($287 million)
3. Morehouse School of Medicine ($286 million)
4. Hampton University ($270 million)
5. Tuskegee University ($242 million)

8. Spelman College ($199 million)
9. Morehouse College ($188 million)
10. Bethune-Cookman University ($136 million)
Total Value-Added Impact
Because value-added (gross regional product)
impacts exclude expenditures related to foreign and
domestic trade, they provide a much more accurate
measure of the actual economic benefits flowing

to businesses and households in a region than the
more inclusive output impacts. The value-added
impacts are reported in Tables 1 and 2.
The 100 HBCUs collectively generated a valueadded
impact of $10.1 billion. For all institutions
combined, the value-added impact equaled 68
percent of the $14.8 billion output impact. Domestic
and foreign trade comprised the remaining 32
percent of the output impact.
Public HBCUs accounted for $6.5 billion of the
value-added impact, or 64 percent of the total
amount. In order, the schools with the 10 largest
value-added impacts were:
1. Florida A&M University ($374 million)
2. Texas Southern University ($348 million)
3. North Carolina A&T State University
($336 million)
4. Tennessee State University ($308 million)
5. Morgan State University ($305 million)
6. Prairie View A&M University ($268 million)
7. Jackson State University ($267 million)
8. North Carolina Central University ($239 million)
9. The University of the District of Columbia
($214 million)
10. Norfolk State University ($186 million)
Private HBCUs accounted for $3.6 billion of the
value-added impact, or 36 percent of the total
amount. The 10 largest (in order) were:
1. Howard University ($1.1 billion)
2. Meharry Medical College ($207 million)
3. Morehouse School of Medicine ($207 million)
4. Hampton University ($177 million)
5. Tuskegee University ($154 million)
6. Clark Atlanta University ($137 million)
7. Xavier University of Louisiana ($135 million)
8. Spelman College ($134 million)
9. Morehouse College ($125 million)
10. Bethune-Cookman University ($88 million)
Labor Income Impact
Collectively, HBCUs generated a labor income
impact of $7.3 billion in 2014. The labor income
received by residents of the cities that host these
institutions represents 72 percent of the valueadded
impact. Labor income impacts are reported
in Tables 1 and 2.
Public HBCUs accounted for $4.7 billion of the labor
income impact, or 65 percent of the total amount. In
order, the 10 largest were:
1. Florida A&M University ($276 million)
2. North Carolina A&T State University

Employment Impact
The economic impact of having an HBCU in town
is most easily understood in terms of its effects on
employment. Collectively, the 100 HBCUs generated
an employment impact of 134,090 jobs in 2014.
To provide perspective, the rolled-up employment
impact of the nation’s HBCUs exceeded the number
of jobs at Oracle (132,000 jobs), Convergys (130,000
jobs), and Honeywell International (129,000 jobs),
the nation’s 48th, 49th, and 50th largest private
employers, respectively (Fortune 500).
Approximately 43 percent (57,868 jobs) of the
134,090 jobs were on-campus jobs at one of the
HBCUs and 57 percent (76,222 jobs) were offcampus
jobs in the private and public sectors. On
average, for each job created on campus there
were 1.3 off-campus jobs that existed because of
spending related to the HBCU. For all institutions
combined, 13 jobs were generated for each million
dollars of initial spending in 2014. A multiplier of
13 jobs for each million dollars of initial spending
is reasonable for the higher education industry. It is
lower than found in many labor-intensive, low-wage
industries such as childcare or home healthcare.
It is higher than found in many capital-intensive,
high-wage industries such as manufacturing or
electric utilities.
Collectively, the employment impacts of the 100
HBCUs are reported in Table 1. Employment
impacts for the individual institutions are reported
in Table 2. For each institution, a break out of
on-campus and off-campus jobs that exist due to
institution-related spending is reported in Table 5.
Public HBCUs accounted for 89,932 jobs out of a
total employment impact of 134,090 jobs, or 67

Comparisons to Previous Estimates
In 2006, the NCES published a study by the author
(Humphreys, 2006) that estimated the economic
impact of the nation’s HBCUs on their regional
economies. The estimates were for 2001, but the
methodology was not the same as that used in
this study. This was particularly obvious in the
overestimated employment impacts.
The combined initial spending of the nation’s
HBCUs (101 institutions in 2001) was $6.6 billion.
The total output impact was $10.2 billion in 2001.
The 101 HBCUs collectively generated a valueadded
impact of $6 billion, a labor income impact
of $4 billion, and a total employment impact of
180,142 full- and part-time jobs.
With the exception of the employment impact, the
2014 impact estimates are significantly higher.
Specifically, on an inflation-adjusted basis, initial
spending is 23 percent higher, the output impact
is 12 percent higher, the value-added impact is
34 percent higher, and the labor income impact
is 33 percent higher. The employment impact is
26 percent lower, however, due to methodological
differences.
Summary
This analysis utilizes data from several sources
to determine the short-term economic impact of
HBCUs on their regional economies. The shortterm
economic impact of an HBCU is defined as
the change in overall economic activity that is
associated with HBCU-related spending. For each
HBCU, impacts were estimated for the three most
important categories of HBCU-related spending
detailed in the introduction to Part 1 of this paper.
The fundamental finding is that each of the nation’s
HBCUs creates substantial recurring, annual
economic impacts for its regional economy in
terms of output, value-added, labor income, and
employment. In 2014, the total economic impact of
the nation’s 100 HBCUs on their host communities
was $14.8 billion. Of the total, $10.3 billion (69
percent) was initial spending by the institutions
and students; $4.5 billion (31 percent) was the
induced or respending (multiplier) impact. Dividing
the total output by initial spending yields an
average multiplier value of 1.44, meaning that, on
average, every dollar of initial spending generates
an additional 44 cents for an HBCU’s regional
economy.
Value-added comprised $10.1 billion (68 percent) of
the $14.8 billion output impact, with domestic and
foreign trade comprising the remaining $4.8 billion
(32 percent). Labor income received by residents of
the communities that host one or more institutions
equals $7.3 billion and represents 72 percent of the
value-added impact.

HBCUs MAKE AMERICA STRONG: THE POSITIVE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES
HBCU
The collective or rolled-up employment impact of all HBCUs on their host communities, including
multiplier effects, was 134,090 full- and part-time jobs. Approximately 43 percent of these positions were
on campus (57,868 HBCU employees) and 57 percent (76,222 jobs) were off-campus positions in the private
and public sectors. On average, for each job created on campus there were 1.3 off-campus jobs that
existed because of spending related to the institution.
These economic impacts are significant and are generated year after year. For example, in terms of output
(revenues), the nation’s HBCUs would rank 191 on the Fortune 500 list of America’s largest companies.
This is roughly equal to the revenues of CarMax and slightly larger than the revenues of familiar
corporations such as Marriott International and Office Depot.
The economic impact estimates demonstrate quantitatively rather than intuitively that HBCUs are enduring
pillars of the regional economy, generating jobs, higher incomes, and greater production of goods and
services for local households and businesses.
Methodology: Estimating the Economic Impacts
Estimating the economic impact of the nation’s HBCUs on their regional economies involved five basic
steps. First, the nation’s HBCUs were identified. Second, spending by each HBCU was estimated. Third,
spending by students was estimated. Fourth, economic models were built for each HBCU’s regional
economy. Finally, the regional economic models were used to estimate the total economic impacts of
spending by each HBCU and its students.
The total annual economic impact of HBCU-related spending consists of the net changes in regional
output, value-added, labor income, and employment that are due to initial spending by the institution
and its students. The total economic impact includes the impact of the initial round of spending and
the secondary, or indirect and induced, spending—the multiplier effect—that occurs when the initial
expenditures are respent. Figure 1 provides a schematic representation of impact relationships.
Indirect spending refers to the changes in inter-industry purchases as a region’s industries respond to the
additional demands triggered by spending by the HBCU, its faculty and staff, and its students. It consists of
the ripples of activity that are created when an institution, its employees, and its students purchase goods
or services from other industries located in the host community.
Induced spending is similar to indirect spending except that it refers to the additional demand triggered
by spending by the region’s households as their income increases due to changes in production. Basically,
the induced impact captures the ripples of activity that are created when households spend more due to
increases in their earnings caused by direct and indirect spending.
The sum of the direct, indirect, and induced economic impacts is the total economic impact, which is
expressed in terms of output (sales, plus or minus inventory), value-added (gross regional product), labor
income, or employment. Total industry output is gross receipts or sales, plus or minus inventory, or the
value of production by industry (including households) for a given period.

HBCUs MAKE AMERICA STRONG: THE POSITIVE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES TECHNICAL REPORT
Total output impacts are the most inclusive, largest measures of economic impact. Because of their size,
these impacts typically are emphasized in economic impact studies and receive much media attention.
One problem with output as a measure of economic impact, however, is that it includes the value of inputs
produced by other industries, which means that there inevitably is some double counting of economic
activity. The other measures of economic activity (value-added, labor income, and employment) are free
from double counting. They provide a much more realistic measure of the true economic impact of a
college or university on its regional economy.
The regional economic areas are the host communities and include surrounding counties to account
for employee and student commutes. The effects of expenditures that go to people, businesses, or
governments located outside the regions are not included in the output, value-added, labor income, and
employment impact estimates.
The multiplier concept is common to most economic impact studies. Multipliers measure the response
of the local economy to a change in demand or production. In essence, multipliers capture the impact
of the initial round of spending plus the impacts generated by successive rounds of respending of those
initial dollars. The magnitude of a particular multiplier depends on what proportion of each spent dollar
leaves the region during each round of spending. Multipliers, therefore, are unique to the region and to the
industry that receives the initial round of spending.
Figure 2 illustrates the successive rounds of spending that might occur if a person buys an item locally.
Assume that the amount spent is $100 and that the appropriate regional output multiplier is 2.0. The
initial spending in the region is $100, which creates a direct economic impact of $100. Of that $100, only
$50 is respent locally; the rest flows out of the region as non-local taxes, non-local purchases and income
transfers. After the first round of respending, the total economic impact to the region is $150. During the
second round of respending, $25 is respent locally and $25 leaks out of the region, which equals 50 percent
leakage. Now the total economic impact to the region is $175. After seven rounds of respending, less than
$1 remains in the local economy, but the total economic impact has reached almost $200. The induced
(multiplier effect) impact to the region ($100) equals the total impact ($200) minus the direct impact ($100).
The multiplier traces the flows of respending that occur throughout the region until the initial dollars
have completely leaked to other regions. Obviously, multiplier effects in large, self-sufficient areas are
likely to be larger than those in small rural or specialized areas that are less able to capture spending for
necessary goods and services. Multiplier effects also vary greatly from industry to industry, but in general,
the greater the interaction with the local economy, the larger the multiplier for that industry. For example,
the personal services, business services and entertainment industries have intricate relationships with
local supporting industries, and therefore have relatively high multiplier values. Conversely, electric, gas
and sanitary services usually are less intertwined with local supporting industries, and their multipliers are
lower. Multipliers also vary over time.
Analytic Approach
Initial spending and employment for each institution were obtained. Then, the institutional expenditures
were allocated to industrial sectors recognized by the economic impact modeling system. Spending by
16 A STUDY COMMISSIONED BY UNCF
HBCUs MAKE AMERICA STRONG: THE POSITIVE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES
HBCU
students was estimated and then allocated to industrial sectors. Finally, regional economic models that
are specific to each institution were built with the IMPLAN-Online input-output modeling system using
data collected for the local region, not national averages.
It should be noted that IMPLAN and other modeling systems measure the total economic impact of
college- or university-related spending on its host community, but if an HBCU were to close or otherwise
cease to exist, economic activity might not drop as much as the model indicates. This is because some
spending might be directed toward other activities in the region. In some communities, for instance, some
of the displaced students might transfer to other colleges in the region. Since it is extraordinarily difficult
to predict such adjustments, the total rather than net economic impacts of HBCU-related spending
are reported. Thus, the economic impact estimates should be considered the upper bounds on the true
economic impact of college- or university-related spending.
Appendix C reports the geographic areas that correspond to the regional models built for each institution,
which include the labor force directly involved in their economic spheres. In most cases, these geographic
areas are based on the standard metropolitan and micropolitan statistical area definitions released by the
Office of Management and Budget in 2013. The geographic area of the regional model for each institution
also considers population and commuting patterns.
Type SAM (social accounting matrices) multipliers from the IMPLAN system were used to estimate the
economic impacts associated with all categories of spending. These multipliers capture the original
expenditures that resulted from the impact, the indirect effects of industries buying from industries, and
the induced effects of household expenditures based on information in the SAM. The multipliers account
for Social Security and income tax leakage, institutional savings, commuting, inter-institutional transfers,
and people-to-people transfers.
Whenever appropriate, the IMPLAN software applied margins to convert purchaser prices to producer
prices. In input-output models, all expenditures are in terms of producer prices, which allow all spending
to be allocated to the industries that actually produce the good or service. The margins are derived from
U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis data. Moreover, margins were selected according to type of consumer.
For example, households pay transportation, wholesale, and full-retail margins. By contrast, institutions
of higher education may pay little or no retail margin as they have typically more buying power than a
household. In addition, many sectors of the model do not have margins. For instance, because there
usually are no wholesalers or retailers involved when someone rents a room, hotels and other lodging do
not have margins.
The IMPLAN model’s default estimates of the local economy’s regional purchase coefficients were used
to derive the ratio of locally purchased to imported goods. The regional purchase coefficient represents
the proportion of the total demands for a given commodity that the region supplies to itself. The regional
purchase coefficients were estimated with an econometric equation that predicts local purchases based
on each region’s unique characteristics. In addition, to avoid aggregation bias, the entire analysis was
conducted using the full range of industrial sectors.
All dollar amounts were converted to inflation-adjusted dollars. The amounts in this report are expressed
in 2014 dollars.

HBCUs MAKE AMERICA STRONG: THE POSITIVE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES TECHNICAL REPORT
Identifying the Nation’s HBCUs
For analytical purposes, this study defines HBCUs to be accredited Title IV eligible institutions of higher
education established prior to 1964 with the principal mission of educating black Americans. Institutions
for which NCES neither reports nor imputes the required data are not included (e.g., the Utica Campus of
Hinds Community College is not covered). Also, institutions that were not recognized by IPEDS as an HBCU
at the time of this analysis (May 2016) were not covered (e.g., American Baptist College is not covered).
Based on these criteria, the NCES provided the author with its list of active HBCUs that are located in the
50 states, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
Initial Spending by the Institutions
The data source for spending by the institutions was the NCES Integrated Postsecondary Education
Data System (IPEDS) survey, which consists of 11 survey components, corresponding to three seasonal
reporting periods. Specifically, the components used to obtain institutional spending data included finance
and human resources. The most recent finance data that was available at the time of this analysis (May
2016) was the provisional release data for 2013-14. The human resources component of the IPEDS survey
provided corresponding employment data. The survey also provided all institution-level data related to
spending for wages, salaries and benefits as well as other operating expenses.
The amounts for wages, salaries and benefits were allocated to various economic sectors recognized by
the IMPLAN model. For private HBCUs, the amounts for institutional spending other than wages, salaries,
and benefits were allocated to various economic sectors recognized by the IMPLAN software based on the
typical expenditure patterns for junior colleges, colleges, universities, and professional schools. Similarly,
for public HBCUs, these amounts were allocated to economic sectors based on the typical expenditure
patterns for state and local government education. The distinction between public and private nonprofit
HBCUs is important when using the regional models because private colleges are included in a different
industry than public colleges due to differences in inputs and costs.
To avoid double counting, the estimates of initial spending by the institutions exclude some types of
expenditures, the largest of which is auxiliary enterprises. Auxiliary enterprises are essentially selfsupporting
institutional operations that furnish a service to students, faculty or staff and that charge a fee
that is directly related to, although not necessarily equal to, the cost of services. Spending for auxiliary
enterprises, therefore, is largely accounted for in the spending amounts attributed to faculty, staff, and
students.
Initial expenditure amounts for wages, salaries, benefits and other institutional spending are reported for
each HBCU in Tables 2 and 4.
Students’ Personal Expenditures
College students spend significant amounts of money in the local economy as a part of their living
expenses, so the dollar value of this spending was estimated. Since a detailed survey of student spending
habits at each institution was not practical, the estimated cost of attendance prepared by each HBCU was
18 A STUDY COMMISSIONED BY UNCF
HBCUs MAKE AMERICA STRONG: THE POSITIVE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES
HBCU
used as a proxy for each institution’s average expenditure level per full-time equivalent (FTE) student. The
source of the cost of attendance data was the NCES IPEDS website for the 2013-14 academic year.
Student spending includes spending on books and supplies, room and board, and other expenses. The
average student attending an HBCU spent $13,821, which is similar to the average spending levels for all
colleges and universities surveyed in the Annual Survey of Colleges produced by the College Board. These
expenditures are $13,933 for public colleges and universities and $14,556 for private nonprofit colleges
and universities. The student spending estimates do not include tuition and fees, however. The economic
impact of activities supported by spending on tuition and fees is already captured in the impact estimates
attributed to spending by the institutions.
As expected, the estimates of student spending varied widely from one institution to another, generally
higher in large metropolitan areas and lower in small metropolitan, small micropolitan, or rural areas. Of
course, student spending includes items that were purchased for them by others (e.g., parents who pay
landlords directly for their children’s apartment rent).
Student spending was allocated to the model’s sectors based on three sources:
• Various annual Consumer Expenditure Surveys conducted by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)
• A special BLS study in the July 2001 issue of the Monthly Labor Review that examined the expenditures
of college-age students and non-students
• The College Board’s Annual Survey of Colleges
The final step in estimating students’ personal expenditures was to multiply the number of FTE students
by average spending per student. Each institution’s 12-month FTE enrollment (all levels) for 2013-2014
was obtained from the NCES IPEDS website, which was the most recent data available for this analysis.
Prior to multiplying the number of FTE students by average spending per student, enrollment was reduced
to account for students exclusively enrolled in online courses. Initial spending by students is reported in
Tables 1, 2, 3, and 4.
PART 2: THE LIFETIME EARNINGS OF THE CLASS OF 2014
One of the most important long-term benefits of higher education is the additional work-life earnings
that can be associated with degrees granted by colleges and universities. A college degree opens doors
to economic prosperity by improving the skills of its graduates, thereby increasing their productivity and
consequently their lifetime earnings. Certainly, from the perspectives of the students and their families,
the most relevant measure of the economic value of an HBCU education is increased earnings over a
working lifetime.
The increase in earnings associated with a degree obviously will vary from one individual to another, over
time, geographically, and by field of study. A rough approximation of the aggregate benefits to graduates of
UNCF PUBLIC POLICY PRIORITIES FOR THE 114TH CONGRESS
#HBCUStrong UNCF.org/HBCUsMakeAmericaStrong 19
HBCUs MAKE AMERICA STRONG: THE POSITIVE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES TECHNICAL REPORT
the nation’s HBCUs in a given year is possible, however, along with benefits accruing to the average degree
holder. This section presents rough estimates for HBCU graduates who received professional, doctoral,
master’s, bachelor’s, associate’s degrees, and certificates in 2014.
Results
The analysis shows that the 50,037 HBCU graduates in 2014 can expect work-life earnings of $130 billion,
which is 56 percent more than they could expect to earn had they not earned their 2014 certificates or
degrees. So, in terms of extra or incremental work-life earnings, the collective worth of the certificates or
degrees granted by HBCUs is $46 billion, or $926,666 per graduate. Obviously, the economic worth of an
HBCU education over the course of a graduate’s working life is considerable and demonstrates the real
value of advanced education.
The 2,131 students who received a certificate from an HBCU will account for 1 percent of the collective
increase in work-life earnings. On average, the work-life earnings of graduates with a certificate will
be $204,464 more than for persons with a high school diploma. The 4,099 students who received an
associate’s degree will account for 4 percent of the collective increase in work-life earnings. Their worklife
earnings, on average, will be $463,112 more than for high school graduates. The 33,544 students who
earned a bachelor’s degree will account for 80 percent of the collective increase in work-life earnings. On
average, their work-life earnings will be $1,101,200 more than for persons with a high school diploma.
The 7,840 students who received a master’s degree will account for 7 percent of the collective increase in
work-life earnings. They will earn $431,679 more than those who only have a bachelor’s degree. The 638
students who received doctorals will account for 1 percent of the collective increase in work-life earnings,
and will earn $724,005 more than those with a master’s. The 1,785 students with a professional degree will
account for 7 percent of the collective increase in work-life earnings. On average, they will earn the most:
$1,819,966 more than those who hold a bachelor’s degree.
Although average earnings rise considerably with educational attainment, individual earnings in each
specific education level can vary substantially due to field of study, occupational choice, labor force
experience, and location. Nonetheless, most graduates of the nation’s HBCUs will realize significantly
higher work-life earnings when they have a college degree. For example, work-life earnings for people with
a bachelor’s degree will be 77 percent higher than for those who only complete high school.
Methodology: Estimating Work-Life Earnings
The synthetic work-life estimates for each HBCU are derived from synthetic estimates of work-life
earnings by educational attainment and were obtained from the Census Bureau’s American Community
Survey brief, “Work-Life Earnings by Field of Degree and Occupation for People With a Bachelor’s Degree:
2011,” (October 2012). The estimates of synthetic work-life earnings for certificates (less than 4 academic
years) were based on data obtained from the Census Bureau’s “What It’s Worth: Field of Training and
Economic Status in 2009,” (February 2012).
20 A STUDY COMMISSIONED BY UNCF
HBCUs MAKE AMERICA STRONG: THE POSITIVE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES
HBCU
These synthetic work-life earnings are “expected average amounts” based on cross-sectional earnings
data for all persons aged 25-64 who maintain full-time, year-round employment for the entire time. The
estimates are based on U.S.-level data rather than data specific to each HBCU’s regional economy.
The synthetic estimates are based on median earnings data. Although the dollar amounts were originally
reported in 2011 dollars, or 2009 dollars in the case of certificates, they were adjusted to 2014 dollars
using the consumer price index for all urban consumers obtained from the BLS. The totals that resulted
represent what individuals with the same education level could expect to earn, on average, in 2014 dollars,
during a hypothetical 40-year working life for those who maintain full-time, year-round employment. The
estimates therefore are illustrative and do not predict actual future earnings. They especially are not likely
to apply to those who do not anticipate full-time, year-round employment.
As expected, work-life earnings increase dramatically with education level (Table 6). Over a working
lifetime, a high school graduate can expect to earn $1,436,484. By contrast, the average person with a
certificate (less than four academic years) earns $1,640,949, the average person with an associate’s degree
earns $1,899,596, and the average bachelor’s degree holder earns $2,537,683. The average person with a
master’s earns $2,969,363, the average person with a doctoral degree will earn $3,693,368 and the average
person with a professional degree earns $4,357,650, the highest estimate for all degrees and certificates.
Incremental or extra work-life earnings per degree also are reported in Table 6. Incremental work-life
earnings are defined for the different levels of certificates and degrees as follows:
• For graduates with a certificate (of less than four academic years), their incremental earnings ($204,464)
are the difference between their synthetic work-life earnings and those of people with a high school
diploma.
• For people with an associate’s degree, their incremental earnings ($463,112) are the difference between
their synthetic work-life earnings and those of people with a high school diploma.
• For graduates with a bachelor’s degree, their incremental earnings ($1,101,200) are the difference
between their synthetic work-life earnings and those of people with a high school diploma.
• For graduates with a master’s degree, their incremental earnings ($431,679) are the difference between
their synthetic work-life earnings and those of people with a bachelor’s degree.
• For graduates with a doctoral degree, their incremental earnings ($724,005) are the difference between
their synthetic work-life earnings and those of people with a master’s degree.
• For graduates with a professional degree, their incremental earnings ($1,819,966) are the difference
between their synthetic work-life earnings and those of people with a bachelor’s degree.

The NCES IPEDS provided counts of the number of students who earned degrees or certificates in 2014.
(These are not unduplicated counts, implying there is a slight potential for double counting of persons
who earned multiple degrees in 2014.) It’s also important to note that this report does not include lifetime
earnings estimates for graduates who received post-baccalaureate or post-master’s certificates, which is
less than 0.5 percent of total degrees and awards granted by HBCUs in 2014.
According to the data, 50,037 students received a degree or certificate from an HBCU in 2014. Two-thirds
of the students received undergraduate degrees, 16 percent received a master’s degree, 8 percent received
an associate’s degree, 4 percent received a professional degree, 4 percent received a certificate, and 1
percent received a doctoral degree.
For each HBCU, the synthetic work-life earnings of all graduates were estimated by multiplying the
number of students who received a degree by the synthetic work-life earnings per degree. These amounts
are reported in Table 7. Similarly, incremental work-life earnings of all graduates can be estimated by
multiplying the number of students who received a degree by estimated incremental work-life earnings
per degree.

APPENDIX B: TABLES
TABLE 1
Combined Economic Impact of the Nation’s HBCUs on Their
Regional Economies in 2014
Notes:
Initial spending for wages, salaries, and benefits and other institutional spending was obtained from the U.S. Department
of Education, National Center for Educational Statistics, Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), Finance
Data, 2013-14. Initial spending by students was estimated by the author, based on data obtained from IPEDS, 12-month
full-time equivalent (FTE) enrollment (adjusted for students enrolled exclusively in distance education), and each HBCU’s
estimated cost of attendance (room and board, books and supplies, and other expenses). The IPEDS data was extracted on
March 22, 2016.
The economic impacts of initial spending on output, value-added, labor income, and employment were estimated using the
IMPLAN Online regional economic modeling system and production functions provided by IMPLAN Group, LLC.
Output refers to the value of total production, including domestic and foreign trade. Value-added includes employee
compensation, proprietary income, other property income, and indirect business taxes. Labor income includes both
the total payroll costs (including fringe benefits) of workers who are paid by employers, and payments received by selfemployed
individuals. Employment includes both full- and part-time jobs. All dollar amounts are expressed in 2014 dollars.

Economic Growth, Terry College of Business, University of Georgia, 2016.

Notes:
Initial spending for wages, salaries, and benefits and other institutional spending was obtained from the U.S. Department of Education,
National Center for Educational Statistics, Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), Finance Data, 2013-14. Initial
spending by students was estimated by the author, based on data obtained from IPEDS, 12-month full-time equivalent (FTE) enrollment
(adjusted for students enrolled exclusively in distance education), and each HBCU’s estimated cost of attendance (room and board, books
and supplies, and other expenses). The IPEDS data was extracted on March 22, 2016.
The economic impacts of initial spending on output, value-added, labor income, and employment were estimated using the IMPLAN
Online regional economic modeling system and production functions provided by IMPLAN Group, LLC.
Output refers to the value of total production, including domestic and foreign trade. Value-added includes employee compensation,
proprietary income, other property income, and indirect business taxes. Labor income includes both the total payroll costs (including
fringe benefits) of workers who are paid by employers, and payments received by self-employed individuals. Employment includes both
full- and part-time jobs. All dollar amounts are expressed in 2014 dollars.

Notes:
Initial spending for wages, salaries, and benefits and other institutional spending was obtained from the U.S. Department of
Education, National Center for Educational Statistics, Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), Finance Data,
2013-14. Initial spending by students was estimated by the author, based on data obtained from IPEDS, 12-month full-time
equivalent (FTE) enrollment (adjusted for students enrolled exclusively in distance education), and each HBCU’s estimated cost
of attendance (room and board, books and supplies, and other expenses). The IPEDS data was extracted on March 22, 2016.
The economic impacts of initial spending on output, value-added, labor income, and employment were estimated using the
IMPLAN Online regional economic modeling system and production functions provided by IMPLAN Group, LLC.
Output refers to the value of total production, including domestic and foreign trade. Value-added includes employee
compensation, proprietary income, other property income, and indirect business taxes. Labor income includes both the total
payroll costs (including fringe benefits) of workers who are paid by employers, and payments received by self-employed
individuals. Employment includes both full- and part-time jobs. All dollar amounts are expressed in 2014 dollars.

On-campus employment was obtained from the U.S. Department of Education, National Center for
Educational Statistics, Integrated Postsecondary Education System (IPEDS), 2013-14. The IPEDS data was
extracted on March 23, 2016.
The total employment impact, the number of off-campus jobs, and the off-campus job multiplier were
estimated by the author using the IMPLAN-Online regional economic modeling system and production
functions provided by IMPLAN Group, LLC.
The off-campus job multiplier equals the number of off-campus jobs divided by the number of on-campus
jobs. Employment includes both full-time and part-time jobs.

Notes:
The estimates of synthetic work-life earnings by educational attainment for professional degrees, doctoral
degrees, master’s degrees, bachelor’s degrees, associate’s degrees, and high school diplomas was
obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey brief, ACSABR/11-04, Table 1, issued
October 2012. Synthetic work-life earnings for certificates, however, were estimated by the author based
on data obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau, “What It’s Worth: Field of Training and Economic Status in
2009,” Household Economic Studies, F70-129, February 2012. The synthetic work-life earnings estimates
represent expected earnings over a 40-year time period for the population aged 25-64 who maintain fulltime,
year-round employment the entire period. The estimates therefore are not a prediction, but provide
an example of the magnitude of differences in earnings based on educational attainment over a work life.
The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics consumer price index for all urban consumers was used to convert
dollar amounts to 2014 dollars.

HBCUs MAKE AMERICA STRONG: THE POSITIVE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES TECHNICAL REPORT
Notes:
Data for the number of students receiving a degree/award were obtained from the U.S. Department of
Education, National Center for Educational Statistics, Integrated Postsecondary Education System (IPEDS),
DRVC2014 (extracted on May 24, 2016). The number of students receiving a certificate includes all those
receiving awards of less than 4 academic years, but does not include those receiving post-baccalaureate or
post-master’s certificates (less than 0.5 percent of total degrees/awards granted by HBCUs in 2014) .
The synthetic estimates of work-life earnings for each HBCU are based on estimates of synthetic worklife
earnings by educational attainment for professional degrees, doctoral degrees, master’s degrees,
bachelor’s degrees, associate’s degrees, and high school diplomas that were obtained from the U.S.
Census Bureau, American Community Survey brief, ACSABR/11-04, Table 1, issued October 2012. The
estimates of synthetic work-life earnings for certificates, however, were estimated by the author based on
data obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau, “What It’s Worth: Field of Training and Economic Status in
2009,” Household Economic Studies, F70-129, February 2012. The synthetic work-life earnings estimates
represent expected earnings over a 40-year time period for the population aged 25-64 who maintain fulltime,
year-round employment the entire period. The estimates therefore are not a prediction, but provide
an illustrative example of the magnitude of differences in earnings based on educational attainment over
a work life. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics consumer price index for all urban consumers was used to
convert dollar amounts to 2014 dollars.
